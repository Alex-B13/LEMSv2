### Tool Information

* 10-32 tap hole requires #21 [drill](http://littlemachineshop.com/reference/tapdrill.php) (.1590")
* 10-32 tap hole requires 10-32 tap
* 10-32 Helicoils require 5.1mm [drill](http://www.thorintl.com/Drill-Sizes-HeliCoils-UNC-UNF.shtml)
* 10-32 Helicoils require 10-32 STI tap
* 10-32 Helicoils require Helicoil insertion tool
* Bottom plate requires Loctite
* Plates require 3D printer
* Pipe requires saw

### Build Instructions

1. 3D print bottom and top plate. First test is with sparse fill but solid fill will work too (more expensive but better). Keep in mind that a sparse fill will absorb water better, and will also leak cleaning fluid for some time after manufacturing.
2. If the prints are completely dry, this would be a good point to paint the pieces for weather resistance
3. Tap the three holes on the face of the bottom plate with the 10-32 tap
4. Tap the three holes on the edge of the bottom plate and the one hole on the edge of the top plate with the 10-32 STI tap
5. Insert helicoils into all edge holes that have been tapped with 10-32 STI tap
6. This is another point where paint can be applied
7. Insert threaded rods with thread locker onto three holes on face of bottom plate
8. Put springs over threaded rods
9. Put top plate on top of springs through threaded rods
10. Insert bubble level into cutout on top plate
11. Thread wing nuts onto threaded rods
12. Insert section of pipe into bottom plate and tighten set screws 

### Usage Instructions

Put LiCor Li200R into top plate and tighten set screw. Zip tie pipe on bottom plate to convenient mount point. Adjust wing nuts until bubble level reads level.
