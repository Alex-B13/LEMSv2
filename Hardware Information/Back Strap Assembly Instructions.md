# Back Strap Instructions

This document describes how to install the aluminum bar on the back of the LEMS case (back strap).

1. The aluminum strip used should be 1/8" thick and 1" wide. Cut off a 3.5" long piece. Use a belt sander to de-burr and smooth any sharp edges. From here on, this piece will be known as the **back strap**.
2. Using a marker, put a dot 0.375" from each short edge of the 3.5" long aluminum piece. These dots are where the holes will go for the rivets.
3. Using an easily removable tape, tape the back strap to the box in the correct position. The back strap should be centered vertically and horizontally on the box.
4. Using a #30 drill (0.1285"), drill a hole on each dot. Drill through the back strap and the box at the same time. There will be a total of two holes in the back strap and box when finished.
5. Place a silicone sealing washer within a 1/4" regular washer. Repeat this process for another washer. place these two washer "assemblies" over each of the holes in the box. Place the back strap over the washers. The regular washer gives space between the back strap and the box, and the silicone washer prevents the elements from getting in.
6. Rivet the box, washers, and back strap together. The rivet head (i.e. the mandrel before installation) should be on the inside of the box.
