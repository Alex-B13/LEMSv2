# Back Strap Instructions

This document describes how to install the aluminum bar on the back of the LEMS case (back strap).

1. The aluminum strip used should be 1/8" thick and 1" wide. Cut off a 3.5" long piece. Use a belt sander to de-burr and smooth any sharp edges. From here on, this piece will be known as the **back strap**.
2. Using a #30 drill (0.1285"), drill a hole 0.375" from each short edge of the 3.5" long aluminum piece. There will be a total of two holes in the back strap when finished.
