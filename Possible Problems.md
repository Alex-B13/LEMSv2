# Possible Problems

This document outlines possible quirks and problems with the boards that should be noted. Please do a bug report through Github to add to it.

* 11/1/2016: Noticed I01 has a scratch on the PCB by the wind direction headers. Bare copper is exposed. Connections are fine (continuity test passed) but there is still a potential for a short when plugging in wind sensor. To prevent this, electrical tape was placed over scratch. Scratch probably happened during PCB manufacturing as silkscreen is printed over it.
* 11/13/2016: E01 may have a bad SAMD21 breakout board. The charge light flickers when plugged into a computer. No potential solution yet, replacement board will be solution if further problems present themselves.
